# The GUI TODO List Kata

Write a classic desktop GUI application (yes, is not a web or mobile application) so that you can keep track of your TODOs.

The application is expected to exposes the following features:

- Create a new TODO
- Remove a TODO
- Update a TODO
- Show the list of all TODOs
- Change the order of the TODOs
- Mark a TODO as _done_
- Show only the TODOs that are marked as _done_
- Show only the TODOs that are still _active_
- Show the list of all TODOs (_done_ and _active_ ones)

A _TODO_ is just a single message, such as: "Buy milk", "Review the code later", "Call Joe".

## Requirements

- You are not allowed to use any kind of Frameworks.
- Libraries such as `apache-commons` and others are allowed.
- The application have to be easily _testable_.
- You are asked to write the best code you ever wrote in your life.
- Build a product that make you really proud of it! Enjoy the '90' :)
